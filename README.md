# RazorPages

This is a simple RazorPages app, where you can add, edit and delete phones. The app has seed data instead of database. The index page shows all the phones in the seed data, and it adds new phones to the list. 

The app is made with Visual Studio 2022. To see how it looks, open the solution file in the code editor you use and hit start!
